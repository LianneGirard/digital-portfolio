```{tab-item} Things I learned
<li> Going through the motions of making a full book was very helpful. When I watch the modules, it all makes sense. The moment you have to actually code yourself, it's so much harder! </li>
<li> I learn a lot about formating and cross-referencing. I enjoy that feature </li>
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
<li> The references and citations were difficult. I had a hard time getting the syntax to work. Usually I reference the slide decks but could not find this covered in any material </li>
<li> Due to spelling and grammar mistakes throughout this course, I sometimes found it difficult to understand what was being asked. It would be beneficial for future classes if modules, assignments and quizzes could be proofread before the next cohort starts. </li>
